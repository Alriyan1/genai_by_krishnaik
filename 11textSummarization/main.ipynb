The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

      "\n",
      "The speech is a thank you note to the people of India, including those living abroad, for the opportunity to serve as the President of India for five years. Kalam reflects on his experiences during his tenure, citing 10 key messages that summarize his time in office.\n",
      "\n",
      "The messages cover a range of topics, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Accelerating development and the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "* Empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "* Building a strong agricultural sector (from seed to food)\n",
      "* Overcoming problems and succeeding through partnership and courage\n",
      "* Building connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "* Defending the nation and its pride\n",
      "* Fostering a youth movement for a developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam shares a personal anecdote about a young girl, Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. He praises her question and assures her that it is a thoughtful question, and he is committed to working towards that goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech is a reflection on Kalam's time in office and his vision for India's future, with a focus on empowering its youth and promoting development and progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of Indian youth to live in a developed and prosperous country. The speaker recalls a visit to a village in Nagaland, where he saw a empowered village council making decisions and taking actions to improve the village's development. The speaker highlights the importance of empowering all 600,000 villages in India, giving them financial powers and physical connectivity to urban societies. The speech also mentions the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which provides urban amenities in rural areas, including physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity. The initiative has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Action) project in Thanjavur district, India. The project has:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Developed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, enabling villagers to cultivate Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, generate power from biomass, process food, and run marketing centers.\n",
      "* Trained villagers to develop 55 lifestyle products with international standards, in collaboration with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women.\n",
      "* Enhanced the innovative abilities of the people in 65 villages, enabling them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker suggests that similar PURA projects are needed across the country, with an estimated 7000 projects required to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is sharing two enriching experiences. Firstly, they met over 6,000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in the various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker mentioned that farmers are the backbone of the nation and emphasized the need to empower them to protect and nurture the land for a second green revolution. They expressed confidence that the agricultural GDP growth can increase by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries, particularly for value addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker shared an experience they had at Coimbatore in February 2007. They met Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born without hands and legs, who had a radiant and happy state of mind. Despite his physical limitations, he was confident and grateful for the help he had received from others. When asked what the speaker could do for him, he replied that he just wanted to sing in front of them. The speaker was inspired by his positive attitude and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about the importance of overcoming challenges and finding positive outcomes. The speaker shares two personal experiences that illustrate this message.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first story is about a physically challenged individual who, despite his limitations, has a talent for music. With the support of his parents, teachers, and others, he has been able to nurture his talent and even perform in front of a large audience. The speaker is inspired by the individual's positive attitude and perseverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severity of the disaster, the villagers have been able to overcome their challenges and rebuild their lives. The speaker is impressed by the villagers' courage and resilience, and notes that they have taken control of their problems rather than allowing them to control them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of overcoming adversity and finding ways to give back to others, even in the face of challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the courage and resilience of children and villagers who participated in relief operations after a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or tsunami. The speaker mentions their bravery and positivity, even in the face of severe challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also shares a personal experience from their visit to Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they met Tribal Council Leaders and students who had taken in affected victims as their own, showing no concept of orphanage. The speaker was moved by their courage and wrote a poem called \"Sea Waves\" to commemorate their bravery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speech touches on the importance of connectivity for societal transformation, referencing an address to the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a integrated network connecting 53 African countries through satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections, estimated to cost $100 million. The network aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 teleeducation centers across Africa. A pilot project has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, where students from two Ethiopian universities are taking an MBA course from an Indian university and Ethiopian patients are receiving medical consultations from Indian specialists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the achievements of India's technology and defense sectors. The speaker mentions that Hyderabad has been providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, in Cardiology and Radiology since 2006, and is working to connect the heads of state across Africa for instant communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also expresses pride in India's defense forces, citing personal experiences during visits to military bases and interactions with troops. They highlight the dedication and bravery of the defense forces, who work tirelessly to protect the nation even in challenging circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speaker mentions the importance of India's para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in maintaining the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speech mentions the \"Youth Movement for Developed India 2020\" initiative, which aims to transform young citizens into enlightened individuals who can contribute to the country's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker discusses the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They mention a program called Lead India 2020, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh. The speaker shares examples of the positive impact of the program, including increased self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of responsibility towards the nation. They also mention a specific student leader who was inspired by the program to help her father quit smoking. The speaker believes that empowering India's 540 million youth through value-based education and leadership is key to the country's future. They conclude by expressing their appreciation for India's cultural diversity and unity, and highlighting the efforts of various agencies to promote these values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural and civilizational heritage while pursuing economic growth. They highlight the country's progress in the last 60 years, its natural resources, and the hardworking people, particularly the 540 million youth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020 and encourages individuals to strive to empower themselves and others. They quote a famous poem, \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" and emphasize that aiming high can bring success to youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then outlines a vision for a developed India 2020, with five distinct features:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A reduced urban-rural divide\n",
      "2. Equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. A harmonious balance between agriculture, industry, and services\n",
      "4. Education with a value system accessible to all meritorious students, regardless of societal or economic barriers\n",
      "5. India becoming the best destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a utopian nation where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Healthcare is accessible to all\n",
      "* Governance is transparent, responsive, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Poverty is eradicated, illiteracy removed, and crimes against women and children are absent\n",
      "* The society is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, expresses gratitude to the citizens for their love and support over the past five years. He proudly speaks about India being one of the best places to live in and having a leadership to be proud of. He shares his mission to connect the hearts and minds of Indians, instilling self-confidence and a sense of possibility (\"we can do it\").

       "'Based on the additional context, I refined the original summary to incorporate the new information. Here is the revised summary:\\n\\nIn his farewell address as the President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam emphasizes his gratitude to the nation and shares key messages from his five-year tenure. He highlights the importance of preserving India\\'s rich cultural and civilizational heritage, empowering villages, and accelerating development. Kalam cites examples such as the successful Periyar PURA project, which transformed 200 acres of waste land into a cultivable area, generating employment and entrepreneurship opportunities.\\n\\nThe President also emphasizes the need to bridge the rural-urban divide by establishing similar PURA projects across the country, with a target of 7000 PURA. He stresses the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the principle of \"Seed to Food\". Kalam expresses confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries.\\n\\nInternationally, Kalam highlights his proposal for the Pan African e-Network, a project aimed at connecting 53 African countries with an estimated cost of US $ 100 million. He also emphasizes the importance of the youth movement for a Developed India 2020, citing the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which aims to transform youth into enlightened citizens.\\n\\nKalam outlines a distinctive profile for a developed India 2020, including a nation with reduced rural-urban divide, equitable access to energy and water, and a symphony between agriculture, industry, and service sector. He also stresses the importance of preserving natural resources and cultural heritage for future generations.\\n\\nIn his conclusion, Kalam shares his mission to bring connectivity between billion hearts and minds of the people of India and to embed the self-confidence that \"we can do it\". He encourages the 540 million youth below the age of 25 to work towards a developed India by 2020, guided by their aspirations to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud nation. Finally, he thanks the citizens for their support and concludes by emphasizing the importance of making India a developed nation before 2020.\\n\\nOverall, Kalam\\'s speech is a testament to the power of human spirit, perseverance, and partnership in overcoming challenges and building a better future for India, as well as his commitment to global cooperation and development.'"
